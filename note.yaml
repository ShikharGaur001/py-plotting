## Setting the Python Interpreter in VS Code

When you create a virtual environment (venv) in your project, a new Python executable is placed inside the `venv/Scripts` directory (on Windows). To use this Python interpreter in VS Code:

1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the Command Palette.
2. Type and select `Python: Select Interpreter`.
3. Browse to your project's `venv\Scripts` folder and select the `python.exe` file.
4. VS Code will now use this interpreter for running and debugging Python code in this workspace.

This ensures your project uses the correct dependencies and environment.

## Creating a Virtual Environment and Installing matplotlib

1. Open a terminal in your project folder.
2. Run the following command to create a virtual environment named `venv` in the current folder:

	```powershell
	python -m venv .\venv
	```

3. Close the terminal and open a new one to ensure the environment is recognized by VS Code.
4. Select the interpreter as described above (choose the `venv\Scripts\python.exe`).
5. With the correct interpreter selected, install matplotlib:

	```powershell
	pip install matplotlib
	```

Now you are ready to start plotting with matplotlib in your isolated environment!
