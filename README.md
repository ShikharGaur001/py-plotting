# Python Matplotlib Pyplot Learning & Practice Tour

This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing data visualization in Python using the `matplotlib` library, especially its `pyplot` interface. Here, you'll find code samples, notes, and experiments to help you master plotting in Python.

## What You'll Find

- Example scripts using `matplotlib.pyplot`
- Practice exercises and visualizations
- Notes and tips for effective plotting

> **Note:** There is already a small example for plotting in the `p1.py` file, and the result is saved as `p1-1.png`.
